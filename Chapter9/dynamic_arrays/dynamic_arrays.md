# Dynamically Allocating Arrays

See **example1.cpp** in current directory.

## Quiz time!

Question #1

Write a program that:
* Asks the user how many names they wish to enter.
* Dynamically allocates a std::string array.
* Asks the user to enter each name.
* Calls std::sort to sort the names (See 9.4 -- Sorting an array using selection sort and 9.11 -- Pointer arithmetic and array indexing)
* Prints the sorted list of names.

std::string supports comparing strings via the comparison operators < and >. You donâ€™t need to implement string comparison by hand.

Your output should match this:

How many names would you like to enter? 5
Enter name #1: Jason
Enter name #2: Mark
Enter name #3: Alex
Enter name #4: Chris
Enter name #5: John

Here is your sorted list:
Name #1: Alex
Name #2: Chris
Name #3: Jason
Name #4: John
Name #5: Mark

> To use std::sort() with a pointer to an array, calculate begin and end manually
> `std::sort(array, array + arrayLength);`

## ANSWER:
See names.cpp in current directory.
