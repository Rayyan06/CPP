# Void Pointers

## Quiz time!

1. What's the difference between a void pointer and a null pointer

>A void pointer is a pointer that can point to any type of object, but does not know what type of object it points to. A void pointer must be explicitly cast into another type of pointer to perform indirection. A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to an address. A void pointer can be a null pointer.
