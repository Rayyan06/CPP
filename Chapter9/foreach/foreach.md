# Foreach loops

## Quiz time!

1. Declare a fixed array with the following names: Alex, Betty, Caroline, Dave, Emily, Fred, Greg, and Holly. Ask the user to enter a name. Use a for each loop to see if the name the user entered is in the array.
Sample output:

Enter a name: Betty
Betty was found.
Enter a name: Megatron
Megatron was not found.
Hint: Use std::string_view as your array type.
